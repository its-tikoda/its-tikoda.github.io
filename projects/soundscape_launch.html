            <p><a href="https://www.dareshack.com/" target="_blank">Dareshack</a>, a trailblazer in Bristol's music scene, provides an inventive space known as 'The Grid' for artists to delve into their creative pursuits. In late 2022, the venue upped its game by installing the d&b Soundscape system, a 16.1-channel surround setup that has since been at the heart of creative expression for countless musicians, artists, and engineers. For its launch event in December 2022, Theo Passingham was chosen to orchestrate the visual elements of the evening, showcasing acts like The Breath, Paul Nolan, Ishmael Ensemble, and Loss >< Gain.</p>
            <p>Theo's vision for the launch was to craft a visual experience that would engage the audience with the spatial dynamics of the sound, aiming for an immersive, emotive display that complemented rather than overshadowed the audio. In collaboration with the sound engineers, they arranged a four-projector setup, casting images on each wall to create an enveloping environment without a focal point, enhancing the venue's ambience.</p>
            <p>Minimalist visuals, such as a simple circle or grid, were projected onto the venue's black walls. These projections would react subtly to the sound from the nearest speakers, with a gentle flicker or undulation, often only catching the audience's attention in their peripheral vision—just enough to accentuate the spatial sound.</p>
            <p>The projections, in combination with a smoke machine, created an ethereal effect, with grid lines appearing to float as holographic lasers within the space. This interplay of sound and visuals not only elevated the overall sensory experience but also exemplified Theo's ability to integrate technology and creativity to complement and enhance live performances.</p>
            <p>Theo’s artwork was also used to design the poster, which is often the case for events Theo designs the visual content for - either their own or on commission. They are used to working quickly with clients to create a visual narrative for the event itself and any promotional content needed before or after events. </p>
