            Young Waters burst onto the UK folk scene in 2015, quickly carving out a niche with their captivating vocal harmonies and innovative string arrangements that bridged the gap between tradition and modernity. The band's rapid rise to festival favourite status and critical acclaim can be largely attributed to the extensive contributions of Theo Passingham. As the primary composer, agent, and manager, they were instrumental in shaping the band's trajectory. Theo's influence on Young Waters spanned the creative process to the intricacies of industry management, significantly impacting the band's growth and recognition.

            Theo served as the primary composer and arranger for Young Waters. Their collaborative spirit was the heart of the composition process, with Theo taking the lead as the primary lyricist. Their keen sense for storytelling and arranging strings crafted the distinctive auditory experience that became synonymous with Young Waters' identity.

            As the band's agent and manager, Theo navigated the complexities of the music industry, managing bookings and contracts that brought Young Waters to prominent stages across the UK. Their efforts led to performances at major festivals such as Glastonbury, Shambala, and Boomtown, alongside revered folk festivals like Purbeck, Folk East, and Broadstairs. Theo also managed the band's interactions with the music publishing industry, negotiating with Monokrome and Bucks Music to ensure the band's creative output was distributed and protected appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Young Waters extended their reach through tours across the UK, Ireland, and Europe. They released three singles, one album, and one EP during this period. In addition, they supported acts such as Kathryn Tickell, Tankus the Henge, The Langan Band, and The Breath, engagements that showcased Young Waters' talents and furthered their exposure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2016 Bath Festival New Shoots Award was a significant milestone for Young Waters, resulting from Theo's leadership. This accolade afforded them a recording session at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios, where they produced their self-titled debut album. The album received high praise, including a 5-star review from Northern Sky and a 4-star rating from Songlines, and was featured on BBC Radio 2, 6, and 3, as well as at the English Folk Expo.
